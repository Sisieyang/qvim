all credit goes to Simon (http://code.kx.com/wsvn/code/contrib/simon/vim/)

i only added two things which i find helpful

- query specific keywords are highlighted differently, they include select, update, upsert, insert, exec, delete, by and from
- local variables also highlighted differently, they include all single and double letter variable names. e.g. x,y,z,d,t,xx,yy,zz (but exclude built in keywords like aj and lj)

to install add contents of .vim to your own and append .vimrc to yours
